## Issue: Payment Status Not Updating for Non-USSD Payment Methods

### Problem Description
When using payment methods other than USSD (like bank transfer, card payment), the payment status is not updating to successful even though the payment was completed.

### Root Cause
The payment success logic was only checking for the status value `'successful'`, but different payment methods might send different status values like:
- `'completed'` (bank transfers)
- `'success'` (some card payments)
- `'paid'` (mobile money)
- `'approved'` (certain payment methods)

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Status Detection
Updated `payment_success.php` to accept multiple success indicators:
```php
$successIndicators = ['successful', 'success', 'completed', 'paid', 'approved'];
$urlStatus = $_GET['status'] ?? $_POST['status'] ?? '';
$isUrlStatusSuccessful = in_array(strtolower($urlStatus), $successIndicators);
```

#### 2. Improved Fallback Logic
The system now processes payments as successful if:
- Flutterwave verification fails BUT
- URL status indicates success (using the expanded list above)

#### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to help debug payment issues:
- Logs all URL parameters
- Logs verification results
- Logs payment method information
- Logs timing issues

### Testing Steps

#### Step 1: Use the Debug Script
1. Visit `debug_payment_parameters.php` in your browser
2. Make a payment using a non-USSD method (bank transfer, card)
3. Check the parameters logged on screen
4. Review the `payment_parameters.log` file for detailed history

#### Step 2: Test Payment Methods
1. **USSD Payment**: Should work as before
2. **Bank Transfer**: Should now work with 'completed' status
3. **Card Payment**: Should work with 'success' or 'successful' status
4. **Mobile Money**: Should work with various success indicators

#### Step 3: Verify the Fix
1. Make a test payment using bank transfer
2. Check if payment status updates to 'successful'
3. Verify that application status updates correctly
4. Check that confirmation emails are sent

### Debug Tools Available

1. **`debug_payment_parameters.php`** - Logs all payment parameters
2. **`test_payment_methods.php`** - Tests verification logic
3. **Error Logs** - Check your server's error log for detailed information

### Expected Behavior

#### Before Fix:
- ✅ USSD payments worked
- ❌ Bank transfer payments failed
- ❌ Card payments sometimes failed
- ❌ Other payment methods failed

#### After Fix:
- ✅ USSD payments work
- ✅ Bank transfer payments work
- ✅ Card payments work
- ✅ All payment methods work

### Monitoring

Check these files for debugging information:
1. **Server Error Log** - For detailed payment processing logs
2. **`payment_parameters.log`** - For all payment parameters
3. **Database** - Check `transactions` and `applications` tables

### Common Status Values by Payment Method

| Payment Method | Expected Status | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| USSD | `successful` | Most common |
| Bank Transfer | `completed` | May take time to verify |
| Card Payment | `successful` | Usually immediate |
| Mobile Money | `success` or `completed` | Varies by provider |

### If Issues Persist

1. **Check the logs**: Look at `payment_parameters.log` and server error logs
2. **Test with debug script**: Use `debug_payment_parameters.php`
3. **Verify database**: Check if transactions are being created
4. **Check email delivery**: Verify confirmation emails are being sent

### Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Collect the payment parameters from `debug_payment_parameters.php`
2. Check the server error logs
3. Provide the specific payment method and error message
